It is crucial that what goes on in this house and family is documented. It is a tool to remind me how sick it is when the day seems normal or when we are 'playing house' like nothing is wrong. It will show where gaslighting and manipulation tactics are being used. 

Another benefit it provides is evidence. When it is time to serve, this will help keep it organized and concise. Some of the feelings will be removed, so it is not an emotional attack. Rather it is fact-based.

The initial list....

-purposely waking me up when he came home and he's mad, will never get over it 
-never getting the after midnight text request (the ONE "rule")
-Elvie nearly broke his toe
-kids cannot be outside (just get mad, not train)
-must be something wrong with my ears when he mumbles
-dwindling profits, fears for job
-unexplained $1k he withdraws in cash monthly
-the garage being spotless
-the priority of the garage overall
-sheets on bed (he's the sheet snob, yet i cannot buy)
-replacing the toilet big issue
-sewer backup was my fault
-I do not have an ATM card for shared accounts
-my $200 each spending money rejected
-$100 limit for indiv purchases without permission
-younger slept through at grandma's at family event
-no to $997 class, not even discussion, how can i think that is reasonable
-Easter 2018
