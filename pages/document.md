It is crucial that what goes on in this house and family is documented. It is a tool to remind me how sick it is when the day seems normal or when we are 'playing house' like nothing is wrong. It will show where gaslighting and manipulation tactics are being used. 

Another benefit it provides is evidence. When it is time to serve, this will help keep it organized and concise. Some of the feelings will be removed, so it is not an emotional attack. Rather it is fact-based.
