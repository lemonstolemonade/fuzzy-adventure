Once upon a time, I was born into a middle class family in the Midwest. Though I have lived in a few different states, my life and family are in the Midwest today. After several relationships and single phases, I met Husband. We fell in love, got married, had a baby, had another baby, and got a minivan. You know the drill. I left my career, where I had been a 6-figure earner for 10 years. (This is important for context.) I left my graduate program, where only a document stood between me and the piece of paper. Basically, I became mom first, me last. It is not what I had in mind or what had been discussed at the beginning. I love my kids more than anything, and I want to do right by them. It has been my goal to bring kind and loving children to the world with a strong: work ethic; sense of self; sense of right and wrong; boundaries.

On this journey of motherhood, many challenges have presented themselves that compound the differences Husband and I have and add another dimension of challenge. It is generally not easy. I have lost track of how many strands there are, and it is a tangled mess. Every cell in my body has been affected by the discord. This blog is meant as a journal to keep track of what is going on in motherhood and marriage. It is the qualitative aspect that I need to see, especially as time elapses. Five years ago I was making six figures. Today I am not living a free life. That is not just about kids. It is important to see this progression and have a reference point as the next five years unfold.

**It is important that I remain anonymous in name and face on this site.**

Several people in my ‘circle’ have presented their opinions on the best course of action. I am aware of some of the things that are going on, and denial was a lot easier. Getting where we are did not happen instantly. Changing it is not as simple as one action. I don’t know where this journey is going. I do know that I have a right to a say in my life. Today I am married to Husband and mom to two kids. I am taking steps to open other possibilities within the construct of marriage.

There are some topics that may not sit well with you. There are some topics that may provide insight or entertainment. You are welcome to come along on my journey, and I hope you get something out of it in any case.
