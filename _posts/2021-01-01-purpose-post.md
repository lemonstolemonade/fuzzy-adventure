As I began to describe myself and this site, the initial words were "I am a mom". <!--more-->That is the dominant theme in my life. It is not all that I am. > I am a person with feelings, thoughts, ideas, and interests. My name is unimportant, and I prefer to remain anonymous. I'm on a journey, and it could go in any number of ways. Most of those are better with my name left as "This Mom".
I'm not exactly where I thought I would be when embarking on the family path. That's pretty typical. There are more moms out there who experience some of the same challenges as me. Not only is this the place to journal what's going on, it is something that offers insight and entertainment for others. Enjoy!
